To all you BIM hackers (white-hat only) living in this universe...

[SSOE, Inc.](http://www.ssoe.com) is a multi-national full-service architecture and engineering firm that works with an amazing list of very large clients and provides exceptional BIM services. They have an open position for a BIM Software Engineer at their Portland, OR office. [See here.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/computer-programmer-software-engineer-wanted-charles-berteaux-iv/)


### What does a "BIM Software Engineer" do?

She/He improves workflows, saves time & money, increases output quality, by writing custom software with building information (geometric and metadata) in focus. This includes everything from developing add-ons for Autodesk software, 3d scanning of existing construction, working with manufacturing teams, developing team-wide productivity apps, and almost anything you can imagine that is related to buildings, information, and improvements.
