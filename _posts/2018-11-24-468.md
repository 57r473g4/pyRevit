I pushed a piece of test code in pyRevit 4.6.7 that wasn't supposed to be there. Oh well I guess I had too much foor for thanksgiving, hahahaaa.

[pyRevit 4.6.8 is out and is fixed. Download the installer from here](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit/releases)

Thank you and sorry if this caused any inconveniences.
