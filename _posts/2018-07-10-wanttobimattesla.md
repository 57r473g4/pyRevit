### What does a "BIM Software Engineer" do?

She/He improves workflows, saves time & money, increases output quality, by writing custom software with building information (geometric and metadata) in focus. This includes everything from developing add-ons for Autodesk software, 3d scanning of existing construction, working with manufacturing teams, developing team-wide productivity apps, and almost anything you can imagine that is related to buildings, information, and improvements.

- Autodesk Revit and Navisworks API
- Autodesk Forge API
