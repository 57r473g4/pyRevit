Hey all,
For many years I have been using Disqus as the commenting platform for users to be able to leave comments on these blog posts. But in order to simplify my life a little and focus all communications and issue reporting to the github issue tracker, I've removed Disqus and placed links on the side panel to the issue trackers for both pyRevit and pyRevit CLI instead. I'll add more issue templates to the github repo so please direct all questions and issue reporting there. This also has the addet benefit of faster blog page loads since Disqus communicates with many other social media platforms in the background.

Thanks a lot!
