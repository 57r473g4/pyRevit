[pyRevit 4.6.14 is out. Download the installer from here](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit/releases)

There is a new tool courtesy of [Robbo1234](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit/issues/498)

**Match Paint** can match the surface paints between geometries.

I closed a series of issues in this release as well. There has been a good set of updates to the tools for finding unreferenced and unsheeted views. The new interface is simpler to user and has more options.
