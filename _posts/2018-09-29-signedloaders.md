### Loaders are signed!

Thank you for the support. I used some of the money that's provided by the patrons to buy a code signing license for pyRevit loaders. All loaders are signed (in development branch) and will be available in pyRevit 4.6 that's coming soon. This means that the pyRevit that you just downloaded and installed, is compiled and signed by me.

From now on when you're loading pyRevit for the first time, you'll see a message like this:

And here is a proof of digital signature in file properties:
